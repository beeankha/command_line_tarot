### Reversed Cards

In my own personal tarot readings I do not read cards in reversed positions. This has helped me to more deeply learn the meanings of the cards, and also has provided increased clarity to each reading (in my experience). Because of this, all interpretations in this command line tarot reader will be for cards in their default, upright positions.
