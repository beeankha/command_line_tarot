    The Magician represents strength of will, intuition, self-control, self-confidence,
    autonomy, and diplomacy. The positive qualities of humankind: skill, initiative,
    intelligence, discernment, and comprehension; freedom from control by others. All
    of these can lead to success and the ability to control your environment.

    Think about the times that you've wanted something so badly that you mustered every
    ounce of your power to make it happen; the Magician represents *that* level of willpower.
    This card also means skill, talent, and having all the tools you need to make incredible
    things happen.

    In effect, the Magician is one who has the potential to be like a god. If this card
    represents the querent, then you are the one who has the power (or the potential for it)
    to control your immediate world. Are you developing this potential or throwing it away on
    demonstrations of mundanity? The rest of the cards in the reading can illuminate this.

    The power is yours. It's up to you to stand in that power.
