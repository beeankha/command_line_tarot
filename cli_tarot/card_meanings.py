    Do you have a new relationship or journey coming up in your life? If you are about to start
    a new business venture, job, travel, or relationship, this card indicates a green light
    to go forward and trust that the lessons that come up will be helpful for your path ahead.
    You may or may not know what you're doing, but there's definitely at least a willingness
    to put it all out there, take risks, and try something new.

    When the Fool card comes up, it is important to embrace adventure while also knowing your
    limits. There is a lot of potential here and many ways to reach your destination. This card
    might also indicate a feeling of feeling out of sync with the world (i.e., "marching to the
    beat of a different drummer"), but in a positive way. It might be good to think about how to
    achieve your goals in non-conventional ways.

    Have confidence. You may not know exactly what you're getting into, OR you do, but you have
    no fear of the dangers involved; either way, sometimes the only way forward is to take a
    leap of faith!

    The Magician represents strength of will, intuition, self-control, self-confidence,
    autonomy, and diplomacy. The positive qualities of humankind: skill, initiative,
    intelligence, discernment, and comprehension; freedom from control by others. All
    of these can lead to success and the ability to control your environment.

    Think about the times that you've wanted something so badly that you mustered every
    ounce of your power to make it happen; the Magician represents *that* level of willpower.
    This card also means skill, talent, and having all the tools you need to make incredible
    things happen.

    In effect, the Magician is one who has the potential to be like a god. If this card
    represents the querent, then you are the one who has the power (or the potential for it)
    to control your immediate world. Are you developing this potential or throwing it away on
    demonstrations of mundanity? The rest of the cards in the reading can illuminate this.

    The power is yours. It's up to you to stand in that power.

    The High Priestess symbolizes intuition and inner power. Don't chase the answers; let them
    come to you. Trust your gut and don't force anything to happen. If there is an important
    decision you're trying to make, hold off on trying to make a decision through logic and data.

    Even in the "in between" phase of not coming to any definitive decisions, trust that inner
    changes are taking place within you, even if they haven't materialized yet. Something hidden is
    about to come forth.

    Avoid overextending yourself with other people's emotional and spiritual journeys. Save energy
    and time for yourself while you figure out which path of self improvement you are traveling on.

    The Empress represents the archetype of The Mother, who can teach and maintain domestic harmony,
    personal fulfillment, as well as comfort and security. This card can indicate upcoming events or
    decisions related to marriage, birth, or fertility, either in the literal sense (a new pregnancy)
    or metaphorically (creative motivation, a new business partnership).

    There may be some themes in your life related to abundance, nurturing, and caring of all kinds,
    for yourself as well as for others. If you identify as a man, it might be an sign to try to get
    in touch with any feminine components within yourself.

    When this card comes up, it's beneficial to ask yourself questions such as:

    * How do you show love and caring?
    * Where and how do you express your creativity?
    * What nurtures you?
    * Is there a particular aspect of your life that might need more support and caretaking?

    Is there a need for more structure, order, and control in your life? The Emperor represents these
    concepts and is in direct opposition to "light" themes such as spontaneity and frivolity. Even if you
    would prefer to keep going with the flow, it might be more beneficial for you to get organized in
    order to gain a stronger sense of stability in your life.

    Despite being a card related to authority, the Emperor is not a tyrant who forces you to follow the
    rules; he is more like a father figure who wants what's best for you, and even though you may not
    enjoy structure or responsibility, focusing on those things will lead to better outcomes. The Emperor
    is showing up to teach you that anything worth having must also be worth fighting for.

    The Hierophant represent any institution that contains authority figures who claim to know what is best
    for a group of people (e.g., philosphical or religious institutions, universities, etc.); your current
    challenge is to decide whether or not to follow these established schools of thought and structure or
    if you would prefer to go your own way. Whatever you decide will have long-lasting consequences.

    In simplest terms, this card represents conformity vs "going against the grain". Would you prefer to go
    along with tradition and structure, or do you prefer to break the mold? Since this card has come up in
    a reading for you, it might be best to consider what the benefits would be of following an established path;
    many times, the rules and expectations are in place for a good reason.
