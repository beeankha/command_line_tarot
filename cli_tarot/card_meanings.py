     Do you have a new relationship or journey coming up in your life? If you are about to start
     a new business venture, job, travel, or relationship, this card indicates a green light
     to go forward and trust that the lessons that come up will be helpful for your path ahead.
     You may or may not know what you're doing, but there's definitely at least a willingness
     to put it all out there, take risks, and try something new.

     When the Fool card comes up, it is important to embrace adventure while also knowing your
     limits. There is a lot of potential here and many ways to reach your destination. This card
     might also indicate a feeling of being out of sync with the world (i.e., "marching to the
     beat of a different drummer"), but in a positive way. It might be good to think about how to
     achieve your goals in non-conventional ways.

     Have confidence. You may not know exactly what you're getting into, OR you do, but you have
     no fear of the dangers involved; either way, sometimes the only way forward is to take a
     leap of faith!

     of these can lead to success and the ability to control your environment.
